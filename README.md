# Temperature Measurement App:
## A simple and functional weather forecast application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its features:

# üîß Technologies Used
### - HTML5: Basic structure of the webpage.
### - CSS3: Visual styling with a focus on a modern, minimalist, and clean design.
### - JavaScript (vanilla): Handles fetching data from the API, processing the response, and updating the interface.
# External API:
## OpenWeatherMap ‚Äî used to obtain temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### - The user types the name of a city in the search field.
### - By clicking the search button (or pressing Enter, if implemented), JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
### - The API responds with the current weather data for the searched city.
# The App:
### + Updates the weather icon (sun, rain, clouds, etc).
### + Displays temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
### + Shows an error screen if the city is not found.
# üé® Design and User Experience
### + A compact, centered interface, ideal for mobile use.
### + Smooth animations using the fadeIn class for better transitions.
### + Weather icons using local images and general icons from Font Awesome.
